Miracles and Admonitions at Beth-Horon.</h1><div class="date">17th October 1946</div>

<p>(1) And Jesus is still in the mountains, followed by a crowd of people in addition to the apostles and disciples. Some of the the disciples are ex-shepherds, who have perhaps been found when passing through some of the little villages. Jesus is climbing from a valley to a mountain, along a road, the turns of which follow the side of the mountain, and is certainly a Roman road, with its unmistakable paying and well-kept maintenance, to be found only in roads built and maintained by the Romans.</p>
<p>A squad of Roman soldiers catches up with them with heavy steps and jingling of arms and armour. They turn round to look at Jesus, Who leaving the Roman road, is about to take a... Jewish one with climbs to the top where there is a village. It is a pebbly muddy road, because it has rained, and one&#39;s feet either slip on the stones or sink into the puddles. The soldiers, who are obviously making for the same town, after stopping for a moment, set out again and people are compelled to move to the slides of the narrow road to make way for the squad that passes by in strict formation. Some insults are hissed in the air. But discipline prevents the soldiers in route column from giving sharp answers.</p>
<p>They are once again near Jesus Who has moved aside to let them pass and looks at them with His mild eyes which seem to be blessing and caressing with their bright sapphire irises. And the stern faces of the solders brighten in a remembering smile which is not a sneering one, on the contrary it is as respectful as a greeting.</p>
<p>They pass by. The people resume walking behind the Rabbi Who is in front of them all.</p>
<p>(2) A young man departs from the crowd and catches up with the Master greeting him respectfully. Jesus reciprocates the greeting.</p>
<p>«I would like to ask You something, Master.»</p>
<p>«Tell Me.»</p>
<p>«I listened to You by chance one morning after Passover near a mountain not far from the gorges of the Cherit. And since then I have been thinking that... I could also be among those whom You call. But before coming I want to have a very clear idea of what it is necessary to do and what must not be done. And I asked Your disciples every time I met them. And some told me one thing, some a different one. And I was uncertain, almost frightened, because they all agreed on one thing, some more some less strictly, and that was the obligation to be perfect. I... I am a poor man, Lord, and God only is perfect... I listened to You a second time... and You also said: &quot;Be perfect&quot;. And I lost heart. The third time, a few days ago, I heard You in the Temple. And although You were very severe, I felt that it was not impossible to become so, because... I do not know myself why, how to explain it to myself and to You. But I felt that if it was something impossible, or it was so dangerous to wish to become so, as if one wanted to become a god, since You want to save us, You would not suggest it to us. Because presumption is a sin. To want to be a god is the sin of Lucifer. But perhaps there is a way to become perfect, to become so without committing sin, and it is by following Your Doctrine, which is certainly a Doctrine of salvation. Am I right?»</p>
<p>«Yes, you are. So?»</p>
<p>«So I continued to ask this one and that one. And when I heard that You were at Ramah I came here. And since then, with my father&#39;s permission, I have been following You. And now I am more anxious to come...»</p>
<p>«Come, then! What are you afraid of?»</p>
<p>«I don&#39;t know... I don&#39;t understand myself... I ask and ask... And every time, while it seems easy to me and I make up my mind to come when I hear You, afterwards, thinking it over, and what is even worse, when I ask this one and that one, it seems to difficult to me.»</p>
<p>«I will tell you how that happens: it is a snare of the demon to prevent you from coming. He frightens you with phantasms, he confounds you, he makes you ask those who are in need of Light as you are... Why did you not come to Me direct?»</p>
<p>«Because... I was... not afraid, but... Our priests and rabbis! So difficult and proud! And You... I did not dare to approach You. But yesterday at Emmaus!... I think that I understood that I must not be afraid. And now I am here, to ask You what I would like to know. One of Your apostles, a short time ago, said to me: &quot;Go and do not be afraid. He is kind also to sinners&quot;. And another one said: &quot;Make Him happy by confiding in Him. Those who confide in Him find Him kinder than a mother&quot;. And another one said: &quot;I do not know whether I am mistaken, but I tell you that He will say to you that perfection is love&quot;. That is what your apostles said, at least some of them, who are kinder than the disciples. But not all of them, because among You disciples there are some who sound like the echo of Your voice, but they are too few. And among the apostles there are some who... frighten a poor man like me. One said to me with a smile, which was not a kind one: &quot;You want to become perfect? We, His apostles are not, and you want to be so? It&#39;s impossible&quot;. If the others had not spoken to me, I would have run away, completely discouraged. But I am trying for the last time... and if You also tell me that it is impossible...»</p>
<p>(3) «Son, and is it possible that I came to propose impossible things to men? Who do you think it was that put in your heart the desire to become perfect? Your own heart?»</p>
<p>«No, Lord. I think it was You with Your words.»</p>
<p>«You are not far from the truth. But tell Me, according to you, My words, what are they?»</p>
<p>«They are just.»</p>
<p>«All right. But I mean: words of a man or of one who is more than a man?»</p>
<p>«Oh! You speak like Wisdom and even more kindly and clearly. So I say that Your words are of one who is more than a man. And I do not think than I am wrong if I correctly understood what You said in the Temple. Because I got the impression that You said that You are the very Word of God, so You speak as God.»</p>
<p>«You understood correctly and what you say is right. So who put the desire of perfection in your heart?»</p>
<p>«God did, through You, His Word.»</p>
<p>«So it was God. Now just think: if God, Who is aware of the capabilities of men, says to them: &quot;Come to Me. Be perfect&quot;, it means that He knows that man, if he wishes, can become perfect. It is an old word. It resounded the first time for Abraham as a revelation, a command, an invitation: &quot;I am the Almighty God. Walk in My presence. Be perfect&quot;. God revealed Himself so that the Patriarch might not be in doubt about the holiness of the command and the truthfulness of the invitation. He ordered him to walk in His presence, because he who walks in his lifetime, convinced of doing so in the eyes of God, will not accomplish evil deeds. Consequently he puts himself in condition of being able to become perfect according to God&#39;s invitation.»</p>
<p>«That is true! It&#39;s really true! If God said so, it means that it can be done. Oh! Master! How clear everything is when You speak! Why, then, do Your disciples, and also that apostle, give such a... frightful idea of holiness? Do they not believe that those words and Yours are true? Or can they not walk in the presence of God?»</p>
<p>«Do not worry about what it is. Do not judge. See, son. At times their very anxiety to be perfect and their humility make them be afraid that they can never become so.»</p>
<p>«So are the desire for perfection and humility obstacles to becoming perfect?»</p>
<p>«No, son. The desire and humility are not obstacles. On the contrary one must strive to have them in a very deep but orderly way. They are orderly when they do not imply heedless haste, unfounded dejection, doubts and lack of confidence such as believing that, because of his imperfection, man cannot become perfect. (4) All virtues are necessary, as well as the desire to achieve justice.»</p>
<p>«Yes. Also those whom I questioned told me that. They told me that is was necessary to be virtuous. But some said that one virtue was necessary, some another, and they all maintained the absolute necessity of having that one, which they said was indispensable to be saints. And that frightened me, because how can one have all the virtues in a perfect form, how can one grow them all together like a bunch of different flowers? It takes time... and life is so short! Master, tell me which is the essential virtue.»</p>
<p>«It is love. If you love you will be holy, because all virtues and all good deeds come from the love for the Most High and for our neighbour.»</p>
<p>«Do they? It is easier thus. So holiness is love. If I have love I have everything... Holiness is made of that.»</p>
<p>«Of that and of the other virtues. Because to be holy is not only to be humble, or only prudent, or only chaste and so forth, but to be virtuous. See, son, when a rich man wishes to offer a dinner, does he only order one dish? Also: when one wants to present somebody with a bunch of flowers, does one take only one flower? One does not. Because even if he put piles of the same dish on the table, his guests would criticise him as an incapable host concerned only with showing his means but not his refinement as a gentleman who is anxious to satisfy the different tastes of his guests and wants each of them not only to satisfy his appetite with this or that dish, but to enjoy them. The same applies to him who offers a bunch of flowers. One flower only, no matter how big it is, does not make a bunch. BUt many flowers do, and thus the different colours and scents gratify one&#39;s eyes and smell and make one praise the Lord. Holiness, which we must consider as a bunch of flowers offered to the Lord, is to comprise all virtues. Humility will prevail in one spirit, strength in another, continence in another, patience in another, the spirit of sacrifice or penance in another, all virtues born in the shade of the regal most scented tree of love, whose flowers will always prevail in the bunch, but all the virtues make up holiness.»</p>
<p>«And which is to be cultivated more carefully?»</p>
<p>«Love. I told you.»</p>
<p>«Then?»</p>
<p>«There is no method, son. If you love the Lord, He will grant you His gifts, that is, He will communicate with you and then the virtues which you strive to grow in strength, will grow in the sun of Grace.»</p>
<p>«In other words, in a loving soul it is God Who acts mostly?»</p>
<p>«Yes, son. It is God Who acts mostly, letting man put, as his own contribution, his free will to tend to perfection, his efforts to reject temptations in order to remain faithful to his purpose, his struggles against the flesh, the world, the demon, when they assail him. And the reason for that is that He wants His son to have merit in his holiness.»</p>
<p>«Ah! I see! Then it is quite right to say that man is made to be as perfect as God wants. Thank You, Master. It is now clear to me and I will act accordingly. And You, Lord, please pray for me.»</p>
<p>«I will keep you in My heart. Go and be assured that God will not leave you without help.»</p>
